  "summary": "Diff shows updates in MonthlyCompletionCelebrationModal.tsx (including importing `toast` from `sonner` and adding various camera/capture-flow refs/teardown logic), plus changes to `frontend-file-summaries.txt` and `project_state.json`. From the truncated diff summary, the core requested behavior (close modal on Save to Memories + show a 3s pop-up toast outside the modal while preserving save/refresh behavior) is not clearly evidenced.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "On clicking \"Save to Memories\" in MonthlyCompletionCelebrationModal, immediately close the modal and then show a pop-up notification for ~3 seconds confirming the save, visible outside the modal, while still saving and refreshing the monthly memories UI as today.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt shows `toast` imported but does not show any click handler changes that (a) call `onOpenChange(false)` immediately, (b) trigger a toast/notification with ~3000ms auto-dismiss after the click, (c) ensure the toast is not rendered inside the modal, or (d) confirm that the save/refresh callback flow remains intact. Because the file is truncated, these behaviors cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
