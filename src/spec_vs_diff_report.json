However, the required new default image asset is not shown as added under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` in this diff summary.",

      "reason": "The modal references `/assets/generated/celebration-default-photo.dim_900x700.png`, but the diff shows no added files, so there is no evidence the required image was actually added to `frontend/public/assets/generated/`.",
