  "summary": "Diff adds a new GoalsDashboard page and wiring in App/main, plus Lora font loading. However, key UI/behavior requirements (title rendering, exact 7-card row layout/no-wrap + conditional scrolling, dashed dividers, checkbox toggling behavior, and the end-of-row button) are not verifiable from the provided truncated code excerpt. Additionally, the diff introduces Internet Identity / actor plumbing that was explicitly listed as a non-goal.",

      "requirement": "Dashboard page titled \"My Goals : 2026\" with exactly 7 vertical goal cards in the specified order and color families, matching the reference layout.",
      "reason": "GoalsDashboard.tsx is truncated before any JSX/layout is shown; the diff excerpt only shows data definitions, so the title text, exact 7-card render order in the UI, and reference-like layout cannot be confirmed from available evidence.",
