# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Goals Dashboard instructional text significantly more visible while keeping its wording unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the styling of the instructional `<p>` in `frontend/src/pages/GoalsDashboard.tsx` to increase prominence (e.g., larger font size, higher-contrast color, and/or added emphasis such as weight or a subtle container background).
- Ensure the updated styling maintains good readability/contrast in both light mode and dark mode without affecting layout placement above the goal cards.

**User-visible outcome:** On the dashboard view, the instructional text (“Organize your life: pick a goal (or add a new one) and assign it to the month you want to start crushing it!”) stands out clearly above the goal cards in both light and dark mode.
