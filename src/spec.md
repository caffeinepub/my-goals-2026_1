# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a small instructional sentence above the goal-category cards on the initial “LIFETIME GOALS” dashboard view.

**Planned changes:**
- Display subtle instructional text above the horizontal scrollable goal-category cards container on the first LIFETIME GOALS (cards) view.
- Ensure the text reads exactly: "Organize your life: pick a goal (or add a new one) and assign it to the month you want to start crushing it!" and does not affect the cards layout or scrolling.

**User-visible outcome:** On the initial LIFETIME GOALS cards screen, users see a small, muted instruction above the cards explaining how to pick/add a goal and assign it to a starting month.
