          "description": "Update the existing header Button styling for “Back to dashboard” to a solid, high-contrast appearance using Tailwind utility classes (no edits under `frontend/src/components/ui`). Use the shadcn-ui Button component’s supported props (e.g., switch from `variant=\"outline\"` to a solid variant if available) plus Tailwind classes to ensure strong contrast in both light and dark mode (e.g., `bg-primary` + `text-primary-foreground`, appropriate hover/focus ring, and optional shadow). Ensure `onBackToDashboard` handler wiring remains unchanged so navigation behavior does not regress. Verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
